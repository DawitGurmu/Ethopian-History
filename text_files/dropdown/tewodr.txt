He was born Kassa Hailegiorgis (Ge'ez: ካሳ ኃይሉ; English: "restitution" and "His [or the] power"). His rule is often placed as the beginning
of modern Ethiopia, ending the decentralized Zemene Mesafint (Era of the Princes).Tewodros II's origins were in the Era of the Princes, but 
his ambitions were not those of the regional nobility.
