victory over the Italian colonizers had earned him great fame: following Adwa, 
recognition of Ethiopia�s independence by external powers was expressed in terms
of diplomatic representation at the court of Menelik and delineation of Ethiopia�s
boundaries with the adjacent colonies. After defeating the Italians, he became the first 
black African king in modern history to engage in slavery of white European war captives held 
as slaves inside Ethiopia. Menelik expanded his kingdom to the south and east, expanding
 into areas that had never been under his rule, subjugating and incorporating the Oromo, 
Sidama, Gurage, Wolayta and other groups.
