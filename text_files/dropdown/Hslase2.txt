Ethiopian and African history. At the League of Nations in 1936, 
the Emperor condemned the use of chemical weapons by Italy against his
people during the Second Italoï¿½Ethiopian War. His internationalist 
views led to Ethiopia's becoming a charter member of the United Nations,
and his political thought and experience in promoting multilateralism and 
collective security have proved seminal and enduring. His suppression of
rebellions among the nobles, as well as what some western critics perceived
to be Ethiopia's failure to modernize adequately, earned him criticism among
some contemporaries and historians. He has also received criticism from groups
such as Human Rights Watch for allegedly ruling in a repressive and undemocratic manner.
