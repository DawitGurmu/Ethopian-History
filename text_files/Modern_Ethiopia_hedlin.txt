The Abyssinian empire started to fall apart in the eighteenth century as the Gondar kings began to weaken. 
The last Gondar King, Yoas, was killed in 1769 and along with him went the importance of the monarch. 
The reunification of Ethiopia began with the rule of Emperor TÃ©wodros (1855-68). 
He tried to abolish the feudal system and bring the fidelity of the Ethiopian church under the government.
