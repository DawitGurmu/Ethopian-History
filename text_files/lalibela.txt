Lalibela is a town in the Amhara region of northern Ethiopia. It's known for its distinctive rock-cut churches 
dating from the 12th and 13th centuries, which are pilgrimage sites for Coptic Christians. Carved out of rock, 
the subterranean monoliths include huge Bete Medhane Alem, and cross-shaped Bete Giyorgis. Many are joined by 
tunnels and trenches, and some have carved bas-reliefs and colored frescoes inside.
