 Gondar, or Gonder, is a city in northern Ethiopia. It's known for the walled Fasil Ghebbi fortress and palace compound, once the seat of Ethiopian emperors. 
    Dominating it is the immense 17th-century castle of Emperor Fasilides, which combines Portuguese, Indian and local architectural styles. 
    Outside the complex is Debre Berhan Selassie church, with an interior of elaborate murals, including a ceiling of faces.
