        Abebe Bikila, (born August 7, 1932, Mont, Ethiopia—died October 25, 1973, Addis Ababa),
         Ethiopian marathon runner who won a gold medal and set a world record while running 
         barefoot at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome, then bested his own record at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. 
         He was the first athlete to win two Olympic marathons.
        The son of a shepherd, Bikila began running at age 24. He was little known outside of 
        Ethiopia when he entered the 1960 Olympics and ran the marathon, barefoot, on the 
        cobblestones of the Appian Way. Tied for the lead for much of the race, he broke ahead in 
        the last 1,000 metres and crossed the finish line at the Arch of Constantine in 2 hours 15 
        minutes 16.2 seconds. Four years later he underwent an appendectomy 40 days before the Tokyo 
        Olympics. Nevertheless, he won a second gold medal, running the marathon—this time wearing 
        shoes—in 2 hours 12 minutes 11.2 seconds. He entered the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City but was 
        forced to drop out of the marathon with a broken leg after 10 miles. A member of the emperor 
        Haile Selassie’s imperial bodyguards, Bikila rose to the rank of captain in the palace guard.
         An automobile accident in 1969 left him a paraplegic.
